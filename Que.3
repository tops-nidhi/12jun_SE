`3. What is SDLC ? Explain Each Phase Of SDLC
Ans- A System Devlopment Life Cycle (SDLC) is Clearly Defind Function of high quality software.
	SDLC have 6 phase (i)Planning
			  (ii)Analysis
			  (iii)Designing
			  (iv)Implemention
			  (v)Testing
			  (vi)Mainte nance
(i)Planning:	
		Devloper will ask to client which type of Software/Website Client want after that devloper will give ideas about that Software. 
		
(ii)Analysis:
		what type of sources will be used to run and how long duration it will take to complete Software.

(iii)Designing:
